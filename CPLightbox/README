Not very Cocoa like, but because Cappuccino is primarily used on the web, these lightbox functions may be useful to some.

I'd advise you to use with caution in your interfaces.

Usage:
[[CPLightbox sharedLightbox] runModalForWindow:aWindow];
[[CPLightbox sharedLightbox] runSheetForWindow:aWindow];
[[CPLightbox sharedLightbox] stopModal];
[[CPLightbox sharedLightbox] setBackgroundColor:[CPColor colorWithCalibratedWhite:1.0 alpha:0.5]];

The default background color is an Aristo blue.
