A very old extension to animate simple aesthetic keys on a view.

Usage:
var animation = [[CPPropertyAnimation alloc] initWithView:theView];
[animation addProperty:@"alphaValue" start:1.0 end:0.0];
[animation setDuration:3.0];
[animation removeFromSuperviewOnEnd:YES];
[animation startAnimation];

This will fade out theView over 3 seconds and remove it from its superview on completion.

Note: This is NOT CoreAnimation!
