This is a port of UINavigationController to Cappuccino. Usage is almost identical to UIViewController.

Requirements:
CPViewController
CPPropertyAnimation
Provided Resources

Usage:
Please refer to Apple's documentation for UINavigationController. The main difference is that a CPViewController does not have to represent a screenful of content. Calling [navigationController view] will return a CPView that you can do anything you like with.
